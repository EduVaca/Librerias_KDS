Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

Module "Term1"     (component Term)
   - Term1_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Term1_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term1_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term1_SendFloatNum -Send a float number to the terminal. Due to the transformations the maximum float number is limited 
                according to the following conditions:     - positive number: 9 digits for integer part with 4 digits for 
                fractional part.     - negative numbers: 8 digits for integer part with 4 digits for fractional part.
   - Term1_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Term1_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Term1_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Term1_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Term1_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.
   - Term1_ReadLine -Read string from the terminal. Waits until whole string is read. Method expects carriage return and line 
                feed (CRLF) escape sequence as a string termination.

Module "PD_SCK"    (component BitIO)
   - PD_SCK_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - PD_SCK_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - PD_SCK_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - PD_SCK_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "DOUT"      (component BitIO)
   - DOUT_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "Cpu"       (component MK64FN1M0LQ12)
